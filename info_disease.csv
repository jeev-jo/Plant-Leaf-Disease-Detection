1,Healthy Rice ,Paddy,"The rice you plant is in good condition, as long as no dangerous disease is detected. Take care of the rice so that it produces a bountiful harvest. Thank you","1. Do not use excessive fertilizer. </br>
2. Weeds are cleaned as often as possible so that they are not affected by disease and the plants are more fertile."
2,Brown Leaf Spots ,Paddy,"This disease can attack at the time of nursery and can cause plants to die due to rot in coleoptiles, stems and roots. Attacks can also occur on leaves and grains, if the rice grains are attacked, the quality will decrease.","1. Adjust the spacing so that it is not too tight especially during the rainy season. And it is highly recommended to use the legowo system of planting. </br> 2. Use enough urea and balance it with K elements. </br> 3. Use varieties resistant to mildew. </br> 4. Complete balanced fertilization, namely 250 kg urea, 100 kg SP36, and 100 kg KCl per ha. "
3,Hispa ,Paddy,"Damage was caused by insects and rice hispa larvae. Insects erode the upper surface of the leaf blade leaving only the lower epidermis and then lay their eggs on these leaves. Caterpillars from eggs will eat rice leaves until they are damaged and die. Weed grass, abundant fertilization, heavy rain and relatively high humidity support the attack of rice hispa.",1. Diligently weed the land if it feels like a lot of weeds are growing. </br> 2. Do fertilization sufficiently. </br> 3. Frequently checks what else if there is heavy and continuous rain. </br>
4,Leaf Blast ,Paddy,Caused by the fungus Pylicularia grisea which can infect all phases of rice plant growth (seedling phase - generative phase). Plants that are attacked by blast disease are characterized by brown rhombus-shaped spots on the leaves of rice plants. Severe development of blast disease in rice plants can reach the grain and the pathogen can be carried by the grain as a seed-borne pathogen.,1. Use a balanced dose of nitrogen fertilizer. </br> 2. Rice planting is not too close. </br> 3. Use straw as compost. </br> 4. Weed out weeds and try to keep the land from being overgrown with weeds.
5,Healthy Corn ,Corn,"The corn you plant is in good condition, as long as no dangerous disease is detected. Take care of the corn to produce a bountiful harvest. Thank you",1. Do not use excessive fertilizer. </br> 2. Clean weeds as often as possible so that they are not exposed to disease and the plants are more fertile. </br> 3. Clean the lower rice leaves so that they are not too many and tight.
6,Leaf Blight ,Corn,"Caused by a fungus or fungus, it can be said that the main disease of corn plants cannot be underestimated. Leaf blight attacks like moist and wet environments. This disease is known to have a fairly high destructive power because it can cause severe damage to crop failure.",1. Do not cut the seedlings before planting. </br> 2. Do not plant too tightly. </br> 3. Do not use excessive N fertilizer. </br> 4. Keep clean and remove weeds. </br> 5. Use a bactericide.
7,Leaf Rust ,Corn,"This disease is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi, this fungus will produce spores where the spores carried by wind or water and land on the leaves will infect the leaves of corn plants. This disease is more of a problem in crops used for seed production and sweet corn. As a result, crop yields are reduced because crop productivity is lower and plants are susceptible to collapse.","1. Intercrop with plants that are more resistant to disease. </br> 2. Monitor plants regularly for signs of disease, especially during the rainy season. </br> 3. Perform balanced fertilization with a separate nitrogen application. "
8,Gray Spots,Corn,"Gray leaf spot disease is caused by the fungus Cercospora zeae-maydis. This disease is caused by spores of the fungus that are carried by water to the underside of the leaves and begin to infect them and usually occurs before the corn blooms. If this occurs before seed formation, there can be considerable crop loss as it can weaken the plant and sometimes soften the stem, causing it to collapse.","1. Maintain good air circulation by expanding the space between plants. </br> 2. Weed the weeds between the corn plants, so that the air changes more easily. </br> 3. Check the lower leaves often, if gray spots begin to appear, take action immediately. "
